The javaFlacEncoder project provides a FLAC encoder implemented in java.
It is designed to enable easy addition of FLAC encoding support in java 
applications, though a command line file encoding utility is included as well. 
For usage of the command line encoder, see the "Console Usage" section below.

For more information, go to http://javaflacencoder.sourceforge.net.
See javadocs for information on how to make use of this library in your own
application.



Console Usage:
  <commandName> [options] inputFilename outputFilename
  note: <commandName> will depend on how your version is packaged, if it's
  in a tar file, it will be similar to
  java -classpath <path/to/file.jar> javaFlacEncoder/FLAC_ConsoleFileEncoder

options:
  -bmin <x>     minimum block size, where <x> is an integer in range (16-65535)
  -bmax <x>     maximum block size, where <x> is an integer in range (16-65535)
  -lpcmin <x>   minimum LPC order, where <x> is an integer in range (1-32)
  -lpcmax <x>   maximum LPC order, where <x> is an integer in range (1-32)
  -Threads <x>  Specify whether to use threads. 0 turns threading off, greater
                than 0 turns threading on
  -sf <type>    Specify which subframe type to use, where <type> may be:
